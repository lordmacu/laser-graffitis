Requirements -----------------------------------------------------------------

* Projector - more lumens -> bigger projections
* Mac OS X based Laptop, Windows compatible version will follow very shortly
  (Hello Make Podcast viewers! Please give a week :))
* Builtin iSight is minimum, drawing generally works better with a DV/Firewire
  camera
* Depending on the surface and distance, 30mW++ laser
* Latest version of Processing (http://processing.org)
* JMyron (http://webcamxtra.sourceforge.net/)
  (For Mac's with an Intel processor download the following:
  http://graffitiresearchlab.at/software/jmyron-version.tar.gz)

Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If you're on a Mac with an internal iSight, but want to use an external
  camera, temporarily move
  /System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component to
  for example your Desktop for the time of use.
* Point projector at a preferably big and publicly visible wall
* Adjust camera to see the area that's being projected at
* Set your resolution to 1024x768
* Start the software using Processing's presentation mode (this will run it
  fullscreen)
* Calibrate drawing area by pressing 'r'
** Use the laser to point at the white spot (should be in the top left corner)
** Press 'r' again to get to next white spot
** Alternatively drag the corners of the white rectangle to the desired
   location when in mouse mode. This also enables you to do bigger
   projections, where you can't see all or any of the 4 corners
* Calibrate clearing area by pressing 'x'
** At best put it *outside* of the drawing area, and press 'x' again to
   switch to next corner till you got your rectangle
* Press 'm' to switch off the onscreen menu
* Fiddle with software by using the onscreen menu instructions
* Draw 10 stories high :)
* Document it, add rap, and put it on the web.

Contact & Questions ----------------------------------------------------------

To answer one of the most common questions right away:

Q: Do you have to use a green laser?
A: No, you can change what colour is tracked by looking for the
   "jmyron.trackColor" command in the code and change it so it reflects for
   example a red laser: jmyron.trackColor(255,0,0,color_threshold);

If you want access to the versioning system, have questions to specific parts
of the code or used it for your own projection bombing we're *happy* to hear
about it: them@graffitiresearchlab.at
